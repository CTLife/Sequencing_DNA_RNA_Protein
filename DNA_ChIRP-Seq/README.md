# Upstream analysis pipeline for ChIRP-Seq data.
### Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP), is based on affinity capture of target RNA:chromatin complex by tiling antisense-oligos, which then generates a map of genomic binding sites at a resolution of several hundred bases with high sensitivity and low background.
