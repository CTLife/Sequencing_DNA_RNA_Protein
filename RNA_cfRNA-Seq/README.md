# Upstream analysis pipeline for cfRNA-Seq data.
### Circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA) is a promising alternative for noninvasive assessment of health. Unlike DNA, a cell's RNA transcriptome is dynamic and tissue specific.
### The cfRNA-Seq library preparation is virtually the same as [m6A-SAC-seq](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01243-z):
